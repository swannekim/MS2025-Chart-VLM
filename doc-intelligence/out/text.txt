Abstract
Given the ubiquity of charts as a data anal-
ysis, visualization, and decision-making tool
across industries and sciences, there has been
a growing interest in developing pre-trained
foundation models as well as general purpose
instruction-tuned models for chart understand-
ing and reasoning. However, existing meth-
ods suffer crucial drawbacks across two crit-
ical axes affecting the performance of chart
representation models: they are trained on
data generated from underlying data tables of
the charts, ignoring the visual trends and pat-
terns in chart images, and use weakly aligned
vision-language backbone models for domain-
specific training, limiting their generalizability
when encountering charts in the wild. We ad-
dress these important drawbacks and introduce
ChartGemma, a novel chart understanding and
reasoning model developed over PaliGemma.
Rather than relying on underlying data ta-
bles, ChartGemma is trained on instruction-
tuning data generated directly from chart im-
ages, thus capturing both high-level trends and
low-level visual information from a diverse set
of charts. Our simple approach achieves state-
of-the-art results across 5 benchmarks span-
ning chart summarization, question answering,
and fact-checking, and our elaborate qualitative
studies on real-world charts show that Chart-
Gemma generates more realistic and factually
correct summaries compared to its contempo-
raries. We release the code, model checkpoints,
dataset, and demos at https://github.com/vis-
nlp/ChartGemma.
1 Introduction
Language-augmented vision foundation models or
vision-language models (VLMs) have proven to
be effective in tackling numerous real-world multi-
modal tasks such as visual segmentation, caption-
ing, question answering, and generation and edit-
ing (Li et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023). Though
these models excel when used for general pur-
pose applications in the wild, they often fail to
tackle tasks that require specialized understanding
and decoding of patterns and visualizations (Han
et al., 2023). An important domain-specific us-
age of VLMs is for understanding and reasoning
over charts, given their ubiquity as a data analy-
sis, visualization, and decision-making tool across
businesses, economies, and scientific fields (Hoque
et al., 2022). This has naturally led to the develop-
ment of more specialized foundation models pre-
trained on massive amounts of structured and often
chart-specific data (Liu et al., 2022; Masry et al.,
2023). These models are, however, trained on a
limited source of resources and focus on a specific
set of tasks, constraining their real-world applica-
bility (Masry et al., 2024).
Developing over the success of instruction-
tuning enabling models to generalize to more tasks
and applications (Ouyang et al., 2022), there have
been attempts at 'instruction-tuning' VLMs to en-
dow them the ability to understand charts in more
realistic and fundamental settings (Meng et al.,
2024). These approaches generally depend on
two crucial factors impacting their effectiveness:
(i) Instruction-tuning dataset - these methods ei-
ther use the underlying data tables from existing
web sources (Masry et al., 2024) or use syntheti-
cally generated data-tables (Han et al., 2023) from
LLMs such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) to curate
the instruction-tuning data, and (ii) Base model -
the existing methods either use chart-specific pre-
trained models like UniChart (Masry et al., 2023)
or VLMs pre-trained with weak image-text align-
ment such as LLaVA (Li et al., 2023). However,
in existing methods, both these factors have criti-
cal drawbacks impacting their ability to understand
real-world complex charts.
Existing methods are restricted to charts that ei-
ther have an underlying data table or require meth-
ods to extract them from the charts, often with low

The data table shows the trend of Covid-19 related metrics
from July 2020 to January 2022. It reveals a decline in the
Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) from 80% in July 2020 to 25%
in January 2022. This coincides with a rise in the percentage
of adults who have had Covid, increasing from 10% in July
2020 to 60% in January 2022. The percentage of adults with
antibodies also shows a significant increase, going from 0% in
July 2020 to 100% in January 2022. These trends suggest a
possible correlation between increased exposure to Covid-19
and a lower IFR, likely due to herd immunity and improved
treatment options.
This chart shows the evolution of Covid's infection fatality ratio in Eng-
land, overlaid on levels and sources of immunity. The chart shows that
the Covid infection fatality ratio has decreased significantly since the
beginning of the pandemic. This is likely due to the increasing levels of
immunity in the population, both from vaccination and from infection.
The chart also shows that the Covid infection fatality ratio has been de-
clining at a faster rate since the introduction of vaccines. It also shows
that the most vulnerable groups have been vaccinated and that this has had
a significant impact on reducing the number of deaths from Covid. The
infection fatality ratio has also decreased with the introduction of boosters.
This demonstrates the impact of the vaccine in helping to protect people
from serious illness and death from Covid.

accuracy which are used for instruction-tuning data
generation. These data tables are often incapable of
capturing numerous nuanced details in the complex
charts used in real-world applications (Table 1).
Also, in many scenarios, we are concerned with
representing or understanding general trends in the
charts and not individual data points. On the model
side, existing methods use backbones in which the
vision encoder and LLM are weakly-aligned, ei-
ther due to limited data or architecture, limiting
their generalizability to represent real-world charts.
Instruction-tuning a strongly aligned base VLM
can capture the intricacies among diverse chart ele-
ments and corresponding text more efficiently. We
hypothesize that formulating a simple approach
addressing these drawbacks can lead to an effec-
tive foundation model capable of complex chart
understanding and reasoning in the wild.
We propose ChartGemma, an instruction-tuned
multimodal model for chart understanding and rea-
soning. ChartGemma uses instruction-tuning data
for chart representation learning that is directly
generated from the chart images, capturing more
diverse and relevant information while preserving
complex visual features. This also enables us to uti-
lize a much broader array of charts available across
the web as we are not restricted by the availability
of underlying data tables. ChartGemma develops

over PaliGemma (Beyer et al., 2024) which has
been trained on a much larger alignment dataset.
Since ChartGemma uses PaliGemma as its back-
bone, it is also much smaller than existing chart
understanding models, making it suitable for real-
world applications. We evaluate ChartGemma
across 5 benchmarks spanning chart summariza-
tion, question answering, and fact-checking, ob-
taining state-of-the-art results compared to existing
methods. Our qualitative studies also demonstrate
that ChartGemma produces more faithful and re-
alistic summaries of complex charts as compared
to other methods. Through our elaborate analy-
sis, we put forward ChartGemma as an effective
model capable of understanding and reasoning over
real-world charts. Our main contributions are:
· We present ChartGemma, a first-of-its-kind mul-
timodal model instruction-tuned for chart un-
derstanding and reasoning using data directly
generated from chart images.
· ChartGemma utilizes a stronger backbone
model and more representative instruction-
tuning data, rendering it effective in tackling ex-
isting benchmarks across chart summarization,
question answering, and fact-checking while be-
ing significantly smaller than its counterparts.

ies reveal that ChartGemma generates more
faithful and human-like summaries and is ex-
tremely capable in understanding and represent-
ing complex real-world charts in the wild.
2 Chart Instruction Data Generation
In this section, we present the details of generating
our instruction-tuning dataset. We start by curating
a diverse corpus of charts that encompasses a range
of visual styles and elements (§ 2.1), and then use
it to generate the visual instruction-tuning data di-
rectly from the charts (§ 2.2). We illustrate our data
generation pipeline in Fig. 1.
2.1 Assembling the Chart Corpus
Our chart corpus is assembled using a combination
of various sources across three categories: (i) Syn-
thetically generated charts from sources such as
PlotQA (Methani et al., 2020), (ii) Curated charts
from specialized websites such as Statista which
typically exhibit limited visual diversity, and (iii)
In-the-wild charts harvested from the broader web,
such as WebCharts (Masry et al., 2024), noted for
their extensive stylistic variety. While prior ap-
proaches used accompanying metadata (e.g., titles,
data tables, annotations) to generate instructions
from LLMs (Han et al., 2023; Meng et al., 2024),
our method exclusively utilizes the chart images
themselves for generating instruction-tuning data.
This approach also allows us to bypass the con-
straints imposed by metadata availability. In total,
our corpus consists of 122,857 chart images. We
provide an elaborate breakdown of the chart source
and the statistics across each category in Table 4.
2.2 Visual Chart Instructions
We use chart images directly from the above assem-
bled corpus to generate visual instruction-tuning
data. This enables us to synthesize data that can
train a model to capture not just point information,
but complex trends and relations among the chart
elements. Following Masry et al. (2024), we gener-
ate data across two categories: (i) predefined tasks,
which align with common real-world scenarios and
benchmarks, and (ii) open-ended tasks. For pre-
defined tasks, we generate data for,
1. Chain-of-thought (CoT) involves prompting
the model with complex reasoning questions and
enhances the visual reasoning capabilities of the
model by guiding it through the problem-solving
process in a structured manner.
2. Summarization involves prompting the model
to generate summaries that succinctly capture the
key insights and trends from a chart image that
effectively communicates the primary data narra-
tives.
3. Fact Checking asks the model to determine
whether stated facts are supported or refuted by the
data presented in a chart image. Alongside data
generated from our corpus, we use the training sets
of existing chart fact-checking tasks (Akhtar et al.,
2023a,c) in our instruction-tuning data.
4. Chart-to-Markdown tasks the model with gen-
erating the underlying data tables from a chart im-
age in Markdown format. This approach simplifies
rendering and parsing the tables, enhancing their
accessibility and usability.
5. Program Aided Design (Gao et al., 2022) re-
quires the model to generate executable code that
performs necessary calculations and outputs the fi-
nal answer, delegating complex and challenging
mathematical operations to the code interpreter.
Alongside synthetic data generated from our cor-
pus, we use the Multimodal LLM to create exe-
cutable codes for questions in the training split of
the ChartQA dataset (Masry et al., 2022b), aug-
menting our instruction-tuning data with human-
written questions and their corresponding code.
Open-ended Tasks We enrich our instruction-
tuning data by prompting the Multimodal LLM
to generate a variety of tasks typical in real-world
scenarios. This approach enhances the general-
izability of our models and extends their appli-
cability to diverse real-world settings. Example
open-ended tasks include justifying temporal or

etc. We present concrete examples in § A.2.
We use Gemini Flash-1.5 (Team et al., 2023)
due to its robust multimodal performance, cost-
effectiveness, and high API rate limits.
2.3 Key Dataset Characteristics
To underscore the distinct innovations of our
dataset relative to prior works, we examine two
critical elements: the visual attributes and the qual-
ity of the chart instructions.
Visual Attributes Our instruction-tuning dataset
features a wide range of instructions that emphasize
the visual attributes of chart images. As illustrated
in Fig. 7 in Appendix A.2, the examples highlight
various visual elements such as lines, shapes, col-
ors, trends, chart types, and positions, all of which
are frequently referenced in real-world scenarios.
These enhance the model's visual reasoning capa-
bilities, enabling real-world applications.
Quality To demonstrate the strength of our ap-
proach in generating high-quality and accurate in-
structions, we evaluated 100 randomly sampled
synthesized instructions. We found that our instruc-
tions accurately reflected the chart content in 82%
of the cases, which is a significant improvement
over the 61% accuracy reported for the ChartIn-
struct dataset (Masry et al., 2024). Additionally, we
observed 8% partially correct answers, similar to
that as reported by ChartInstruct. We attribute this
improvement in quality to our method's reliance on
the chart images, rather than using automatically
generated and often erroneous data tables.

Modeling and Methodology
3.1 Architecture
ChartGemma uses PaliGemma (Beyer et al., 2024)
as the backbone architecture, which comprises of
the following two components:
Vision Encoder: SigLIP (Zhai et al., 2023) is
a vision transformer (ViT) encoder . Unlike CLIP-
like ViTs (Radford et al., 2021) which use con-
trastive loss on large batches of image-text pairs,
SigLIP is trained on single image-text pairs inde-
pendently as a binary classification task.
Language Model: Gemma-2B
(Team et al.,
2024) is decoder-only transformer-based (Vaswani
et al., 2017) LLM trained on 3 trillion tokens with a
context length of 8,196 tokens. Its pretraining data
mainly consists of English documents, maths, and
code, making it suitable for chart understanding
tasks requiring strong reasoning capabilities.
We present ChartGemma's architecture in Fig. 2.
The input image is taken in 448x448 resolution and
divided into 14x14 pixel patches, each of which is
fed into the vision encoder as a separate token. The
outputs from the vision encoder are passed through
a linear layer that maps the visual features into
the LLM embedding space. These visual tokens
are then concatenated with the input text embed-
dings and passed to Gemma-2B. Unlike previous
VLLMs (Li et al., 2023) that indiscriminately ap-
ply a causal mask on all image and text tokens,
Gemma-2B applies full attention over the input vi-
sual and text tokens while a causal mask is applied
on the output tokens. This improves the contextual
understanding of the image particularly for repre-
senting complex relationships among objects. We
believe this property provides further advantages
when learning representations for chart images con-
taining numerous nuanced complexities.
3.2 Training Setup
Existing chart VLLMs (Meng et al., 2024) typically
employ a two-stage training approach that requires
an initial step to align the vision encoder and the
LLM for understanding chart features, followed
by instruction-tuning. In contrast, we only use a
single-stage approach where we directly finetune
the backbone model on our instruction-tuning data.
We believe that the first stage is required by cur-
rent methods as the VLLM backbones are aligned
using a limited amount of image-text pairs with

restricted styles and diversity. In contrast, our back-
bone, PaliGemma, has been trained end-to-end on
10 billion image-text pairs covering a wide variety
of styles. This makes our model more adaptable
and generalizable to different real-world images
(e.g., charts, infographics, documents). We freeze
the vision encoder and only finetune the LLM dur-
ing instruction-tuning. This helps in reducing the
computational complexity and also improves train-
ing stability given the small batch size used for
instruction-tuning PaliGemma.
4 Experiments, Results, and Analyses
4.1 Experimental Setup
Baselines We compare ChartGemma against
baselines comprising of open-source chart-
specialist models and VLLMs instruction-tuned
on chart data, as well as state-of-the-art closed
source multimodal LLMs.
Chart-specialist
models include
ChartBERT (Akhtar et al.,
2023c), Pix2Struct (Lee et al., 2022), MatCha
(Liu et al., 2022), and UniChart (Masry et al.,
2023). Chart VLLMs include ChartLlaMA (Han
et al., 2023), ChartAssistant (Meng et al., 2024),
and ChartInstruct's (Masry et al., 2024) two
variants with LLaMA2 and Flan-T5-XL. We also
compare ChartGemma against two closed-source
multimodal LLMs, namely Gemini Pro (Team
et al., 2023) and GPT4-V (OpenAI, 2023).
Downstream Tasks We evaluate ChartGemma
on a diverse set of 5 established benchmarks eval-
uating chart representation and reasoning abili-
ties: (i) ChartQA (Masry et al., 2022b) - a fac-
toid chart question answering dataset, (ii) ChartFC
(Akhtar et al., 2023a) and (iii) ChartCheck (Akhtar
et al., 2023b) - chart fact checking datasets, (iv)
OpenCQA (Kantharaj et al., 2022) - an open-
ended chart question answering dataset, and (v)
Chart2Text (Shankar et al., 2022) - a chart sum-
marization dataset. While ChartQA and ChartFC
focus on closed-ended generation, OpenCQA and
Chart2Text evaluate open-ended generation abil-
ities of the models. We also manually curate a
set of 100 charts downloaded from the web com-
pletely unseen by any model. We refer to this set as
'Web' in our results, and use them for comparing
the summarization ability of the models.
Evaluation Metrics Following existing works,
we use relaxed accuracy (RA) for ChartQA, ac-
curacy for ChartFC, and use GPT4 as a judge
for open-ended generation tasks, i.e. Chart2Text,
OpenCQA, and our curated Web set of charts and
measure the informativeness and factual correct-
ness on a scale of 1-5 (Post, 2018).
To ensure the reproducibility of our work, we
present the hyperparameters of our instruction-
tuning and downstream task experiments in § B.1.
All experiments were conducted on a 4 A100 GPUS
(80GB) machine using the JAX framework".
4.2 Performance on closed-ended tasks
We compare the performance of ChartGemma to
the various baselines on the closed-ended tasks,
namely ChartQA and ChartFC, and present the
results in Table 2. We see that Chart VLLMs
are generally the better performing set of mod-
els compared to specialist chart models. Within

thetic ChartFC and real-world-based ChartCheck
test splits. Particularly, the performance improve-
ments on ChartCheck when using ChartGemma,
which is a zero-shot evaluation, can be attributed to
the fact that our instruction-tuning dataset is specifi-
cally designed to generalize to more realistic charts
encountered in this particular evaluation. We ob-
serve that it is also powerful for its small size of 3
billion parameters, and only lags in performance to
the 13 billion parameter ChartAssistant on the aug-
mented set of ChartQA. The significant improve-
ment of ChartGemma over ChartAssistant on the
human-generated split of ChartQA indicates bet-
ter generalization abilities in understanding more
realistic instructions for complex charts.
Given the state-of-the-art performance of Chart-
Gemma, we next perform a series of ablations to
test our hypothesis on the criticality of having (i)
an instruction-tuning dataset derived from chart im-
ages rather than the underlying data tables, and (ii)
the importance of a strong backbone model.
Effect of the instruction-tuning data To vali-
date the effectiveness of synthesizing instruction-
tuning data directly using the chart images as
compared to using their underlying data tables,
we compare ChartGemma with a version of
PaliGemma instruction-tuned on the dataset pre-
sented in ChartInstruct (Masry et al., 2024), which
was generated using the chart data tables. We
present the results in Table 3. We observe remark-
able improvements when using our instruction-
tuning data compared to the data proposed by
ChartInstruct. The improvements are stark on the
human split of ChartQA, indicating that Chart-
Gemma is very efficient in following real-world
human instructions. The significantly weak per-
formance of ChartGemma when using the dataset
from ChartInstruct is in-line with the observations
of the author mentioning a low (61 %) accuracy
of the synthetically generated instruction-tuning
data (Masry et al., 2024).

Gemma (refer to § 4.3).
Effect of the backbone model We probe the ef-
fect of using PaliGemma as the backbone model for
ChartGemma, which has better image-text align-
ment compared to other VLMs, on the downstream
performance. We follow existing works (Han et al.,
2023; Masry et al., 2024) that use LLaVA (Liu
et al., 2023b) as a backbone and train LLaVA-1
with our instruction-tuning data. We compare this
variant (LLaVA+Our dataset) with ChartGemma
in Table 3 and observe that ChartGemma performs
significantly better as compared to using LLaVA as
our backbone. This validates our hypothesis that
initializing our architecture with a strongly aligned
model leads to better char understanding, reason-
ing, and generalization capabilities.
4.3 Performance on open-ended tasks
We next compare the performance of Chart-
Gemma with the baselines on chart understand-
ing and reasoning based open-ended generation
benchmarks, OpenCQA (Kantharaj et al., 2022),
Chart2Text (Shankar et al., 2022), and our curated
'Web' set. We do not use the BLEU (Papineni et al.,
2002) scores for comparison as done by previous
works, due to the numerous criticisms of it as an in-
dicative metric (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Smith
et al., 2016) and follow the widespread practice
of using strong LLMs as a judge due to their high
agreement with human annotators (Zheng et al.,
2023). We use GPT4 to evaluate the informative-
ness and factual correctness of the outputs gen-
erated by the models and present the scores in
Fig. 32. We see that the outputs generated by Chart-
Gemma are generally scored higher as compared
to ChartInstruct. We particularly see significant im-
provement in the factual correctness of the outputs
of ChartGemma, probably due to the fact that our
instruction-tuning data synthesized using the chart
images captures more complex visual elements and

PaliGemma being strongly aligned leads to better
understanding and reasoning over the charts. Our
findings overall indicate that ChartGemma is able
to produce more informative outputs while also
being factually correct in terms of long-form an-
swering or summarization for the charts.
4.4 Human Evaluation on Summarization
Though using online LLMs like GPT4 as a judge
has been shown to have a high correlation with hu-
man annotation (Zheng et al., 2023), there haven't
been studies on measuring this correlation explic-
itly for chart understanding tasks. Hence, to ensure
our observations, evaluations, and conclusions are
robust, we perform a human study on the manually
curated set of 100 charts, 'Web'. Similar to GPT4
evaluation, we compare the informativeness, fac-
tual correctness, and structure of the outputs gener-
ated by ChartGemma with ChartInstruct-LLaMA2.
We first use ChartInstruct-LLaMA2 and Chart-
Gemma to generate summaries for these samples
in the Web set. We then ask 2 different annota-
tors to rate all the responses based on the above
metrics (informativeness, factual correctness, struc-
ture) from 1-5 (5 being the highest) so we can also
measure agreement between the annotations3. We
present the outputs randomly to the annotators to
prevent any biases towards the models and present
the evaluation results in Fig. 4.
From Fig. 4, we observe that ChartGemma con-
sistently outperforms or matches ChartInstruct-
LLaMA2 on all the metrics, and the findings are in-
line with those observed when using GPT4 for eval-
uation (Section 4.3). We observe that ChartGemma
is equally well structured, yet is more informative
and significantly more factually correct. Better in-
formativeness probably stems from the fact that
ChartGemma is trained on data generated from the
chart images and not just the underlying data tables,
enabling it to learn high level trends and concepts
specific to charts. Furthermore, our instruction-
tuning data and a strong backbone model promote
capturing more complex visual elements of charts,
leading to more factual correctness. Overall, since
our evaluation is performed on charts sampled ran-
domly in the wild from the web, ChartGemma's
strong performance validates its effectiveness as a
strong candidate in understanding and reasoning
over real-world charts.
4.5 Error Analysis and Challenges
We analyzed the outputs of our model, Chart-
Gemma, to understand the shortcomings and areas
for improvement. We have discovered the follow-
ing three patterns of errors.
High Resolution Charts Charts with very large, of-
ten skewed dimensions, present challenges for our
model, which uses an input resolution of 448x448.
Resizing these large images can cause written text
to become unreadable, leading to errors in the pre-
dicted labels and numerical values, as depicted in
Fig. 13. Although PaliGemma offers a variant sup-
porting up to an 896x896 input resolution, it oper-
ates significantly slower than the 448x448 version,
making it impractical for use on consumer-level
machines and GPUs.
Coding Errors While ChartGemma demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance on the ChartQA bench-
mark, excelling in complex numerical reasoning
and compositional questions, it occasionally gen-
erates erroneous code that cannot be executed. As
depicted in Fig. 13, the model sometimes refers to
undeclared variables within the code. We believe
that integrating an LLM with enhanced coding ca-
pabilities could further improve our performance
on the ChartQA benchmark.
Charts with Complex Visual Styles Although
our instruction-tuning corpus predominantly fea-
tures real-world charts from the broad web, Chart-
Gemma tends to exhibit lower factual correctness
and informativeness when evaluated on these charts
compared to those from specialized websites like
Pew or Statista, which have less visual diversity.
This disparity, illustrated in Fig. 3, highlights the
need for further enhancements to improve the gen-
eralizability of chart understanding models across
various visual styles.
4.6 Convergence of ChartGemma
We probe the learning dynamics of ChartGemma
by checking the downstream accuracy with the

number of instruction-tuning epochs and present
the trends in Fig. 5. We interestingly observe
that ChartGemma converges very quickly, with
the best performance observed at epoch 2. We
attribute this characteristic to the strong alignment
of PaliGemma rendering it effective in adapting
to our relatively generalizable instruction-tuning
dataset. This indicates that PaliGemma is a very
efficient backbone for visual instruction-tuning of
chart data, and might generalize when trained with
a much larger number of samples as well. We leave
this exploration as future work.
5 Related Work
Chart Representation Learning Chart under-
standing models initially were either fine-tuned
from language or vision-language models (Masry
et al., 2022b; Masry and Hoque, 2021; Lee et al.,
2022), or pre-trained using chart-specific learning
objectives (Masry et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022). Re-
cently, instruction-tuning of pre-trained VLMs has
been explored for enhancing the general applicabil-
ity to charts (Meng et al., 2024; Han et al., 2023;
Masry et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023a). Though these
methods use diverse sources across the web and
synthetic charts for generating instruction-tuning
data, they utilize the underlying data table of the
charts and train a weakly-aligned backbone VLM.
Chart Modeling Benchmarks With charts be-
ing the standard medium for data visualization
and data-driven decision making, diverse bench-
marks have been proposed to evaluate the abilities
of LLMs and VLMs on chart understanding. These
benchmarks range from close-ended tasks such as
question answering (Methani et al., 2020; Masry
et al., 2022a) to open-ended generation such as ex-
planation generation in OpenCQA (Kantharaj et al.,
2022) and summarization (Shankar et al., 2022).
Chart-specific benchmarks evaluate the ability of
models to convert charts into data tables (Choi et al.,
2019; Masry et al., 2023) or evaluate claims against
given data as a part of general multimodal fact-
checking benchmarks (Akhtar et al., 2023a,c).
Instruction-tuning across modalities and for
charts Instruction-tuning was proposed to gener-
alize the abilities of language models across mul-
tiple tasks (Mishra et al., 2022) and has become a
common practice for adapting pre-trained LLMs
to real-world applications(Alpaca, 2023; Chiang
et al., 2023; Ouyang et al., 2022). The success of
instruction-tuning for text has led to its adoption as
a standard process for multimodal VLMs too (Li
et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2023). Re-
cently, domain-specific instruction-tuning has been
attempted for charts that requires specially curated
instruction-tuning data (Han et al., 2023; Masry
et al., 2024; Meng et al., 2024). These methods use
the underlying data tables of the chart to synthesize
the instruction-tuning data. Since the data tables
of charts are not capable of capturing the nuance
details of charts, especially for real-world charts
with complex elements, the instruction-tuning data
generated using the data tables is not adequate for
training models to be adept at understanding these
diverse real-world charts.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
In the landscape of rising excitement for chart
understanding and reasoning models and meth-
ods, we present ChartGemma, a multimodal
model instruction-tuned on data generated di-
rectly from a diverse range of real-world chart
images using a state-of-the-art backbone architec-
ture. ChartGemma addresses two crucial shortcom-
ings of existing instruction-tuned chart models: the
instruction-tuning data is generated from the un-
derlying data tables instead of the chart images,
limiting their adaptability and extendibility to real-
world, and use weakly aligned backbone models,
restricting their generalizability. Our simple ap-
proach yields significant improvements over exist-
ing chart representation models, with a relatively
smaller model in terms of number of parameters.
Our extensive error analyses and human studies
show that ChartGemma produces more realistic,
informative, and factually correct outputs as com-
pared to its contemporaries.
As future work, we aim to formulate a more
diverse instruction-tuning dataset which is created

=== [Page 9] ===
using human written instructions capturing varied
nuances present in charts. We also aim to propose a
more generalized benchmark catered to addressing
complex visual elements in charts with more chart
relevant evaluation metrics.
Limitations
Despite the effectiveness of our instruction-tuning
approach and our model, there are notable limita-
tions. Firstly, the instruction-tuning data is gen-
erated using a proprietary LLM, which could re-
strict the model's use in certain commercial envi-
ronments. Secondly, the input resolution of our
model's vision encoder is capped at 448x448; any
increase in resolution leads to a quadratic rise in
processing time. Third, we depend on the closed-
source model, GPT4, for evaluating crucial metrics
such as Informativeness and Factual Correctness.
The frequent updates and potential deprecation of
closed-source models pose challenges for the repro-
ducibility of our results. Lastly, the model is prone
to hallucinations, occasionally producing factually
incorrect statements or erroneous code. We advise
users to implement robust guardrails and exercise
caution when deploying our model in real-world
applications.
Ethics Statement
Since our model generates responses autoregres-
sively, it is prone to errors and hallucinations. The
outputs can sometimes be misleading or contain
inaccuracies. Additionally, there is no guarantee
that the codes generated by our model will be free
from malicious content. Therefore, it is crucial
for users of our model to implement strict safety
guidelines to mitigate these potential risks. How-
ever, the base datasets we use for further generating
our instruction-tuning data are available publicly
either as full datasets or URLs with public licenses.
Furthermore, all chart images in our dataset were
sourced from existing, publicly available research
papers that have filtered out any offensive content.
We plan to release our visual instruction-tuning
dataset in the same way as the base datasets (images
where the licenses allow us and URLs where they
do not). We also release our trained ChartGemma
model in easy-to-use demos and various formats
and across quantizations for extremely accessible
adoption by the community. For our human evalu-
ation study, we requested the help of our research
collaborators. There were no personal identifica-
tion information collected during this study. As the
focus of the research was about assessing models'
capabilities and limitations in several chart under-
standing tasks, the human evaluation performed
by the authors does not add any ethical issues or
unwanted biases.

§ 2.1. We show the exact statistics and sources
under each category in Table 4.
Sources for instruction-tuning tasks For the
pre-defined tasks used for generating instruction-
tuning data, we also augment the instructions gen-
erated by the multimodal LLM with the training
sets of existing benchmark datasets.
A.2 Instruction Dataset Analysis
Our instruction-tuning dataset comprises of both
closed-ended response generation and open-ended
answering. Fig. 6 shows diverse visual instruction-
tuning tasks that are generally inspired from ex-
isting chart evaluation benchmarks, and Fig. 7
shows diverse visual instruction-tuning tasks in-
spired from open-ended chart understanding and
reasoning.
Instruction-tuning dataset quality As men-
tioned in § 2.3, our instruction-tuning dataset's in-
structions accurately reflect the chart content ap-
proximately 82% of the times, and are partially cor-
rect 8% times. We present some examples where
our instructions are correct and incorrect in Table 5
and partially correct in Table 6.
A.3 Prompt Templates for Instruction-tuning
Data Generation
We present the prompt templates provided to Gem-
ini Flash-1.5 to generate instruction-tuning data
for the program-aided design task in Fig. 8 and
an open-ended task in Fig. 9. Our prompt tem-
plates draw inspiration from the templates used in
ChartInstruct (Masry et al., 2024) and the ChartQA
prompt used in Gemini Flash (Team et al., 2023).
B Experiments and Results
B.1 Hyperparameter settings
We present the hyperparameter settings for
instruction-tuning and fine-tuning on the bench-
marks in Table 7.
B.2 Prompt templates for evaluation
We show the prompt given to GPT4 for evaluating
the outputs of the open-ended tasks, Chart2Text
and our curated 'Web' set for summarization and
OpenCQA in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, respectively.
B.3 GPT4 evaluation on open-ended
generation tasks
We show the informativeness, factual correctness,
and relevance results on the open-ended genera-
tion tasks, namely Chart2Text(Statista and Pew),
OpenCQA, and our curated 'Web' set of charts in
Table 8.
B.4 Human Evaluation Study
During the human evaluation study, we provided
the human annotators with the same instructions
used to prompt GPT4 as depicted in Fig. 10 and
Fig. 11. We recruited two human volunteers for the
study from our research lab, both were of South-
east Asian (Indian subcontinent) origin and adept
in the English language.
We show the results of human evaluation when
measuring the informativeness, factual correctness,
and structure of outputs generated by ChartInstruct-
LLaMA2 and ChartGemma on the 'Web' set of
charts scraped from the web in Table 9. We
see that ChartGemma significantly outperforms
ChartInstruct-LLaMA2 in terms of informativeness
and factual correctness and they match in the struc-
ture of the generated summary.
B.5 Error Analysis
Fig. 13 show typoes and coding errors produced by
our model.
B.6 Sample Outputs from ChartGemma
In Fig. 14, we provide some sample outputs on
various tasks.

Example Prompt - Generate Instruction-tuning data for Program-Aided Design
Generate numerical and visual question-answer pairs for an LLM that we are trying to tune for Chart Numerical and Visual
Reasoning. Your response should be in a json format where each example has three fields: input: which only asks a
numerical/visual question, program of thought: a python program that can be executed to produce the final answer, and
final answer: which is the final answer to the input question based on the chart image.
For the final answer X, follow the following instructions:
* X should contain as few words as possible.
* Don't paraphrase or reformat the text you see in the image.
* If the final answer has two or more items, provide it in the list format like [1, 2].
* When asked to give a ratio, give out the decimal value like 0.25 instead of 1:4.
* When asked to give a percentage, give out the whole value like 17 instead of decimal
like 0.17%
* Don't include any units in the answer.
* Try to include the full label from the graph when asked about an entity.
Generate ten questions that contain some numerical operations such as, but not limited to, max, min, sum, average,
difference, ratio, median, mode, .. etc. Generate another five questions that not only have numerical operations, but also
some visual aspects such as leftmost, rightmost, top, bottom, middle, peak, colors, .. etc. Generate five simple data
retrieval questions that ask about values, x-labels, or legend labels from the chart. Generate another five yes/no
numerical reasoning questions whose answers must be either Yes or No. Generate another four questions that ask to count
some elements in the chart (e.g., the number of bars/pie slices/colors/x-labels) .
Remember that the program of thought must be an executable python code that solves the question step by step and prints
the answer in the end.

CPI unaffected workers from 2000 to 2021. The x-axis represents the years, while the y-axis
represents the percentage of earnings growth. CPI adjusted workers consistently had lower
earnings growth compared to OPI unaffected workers, with a maximum growth of 4.19% in
2000 and a minimum growth of -0.3% in 2020 and 2021. In contrast, CPI unaffected workers
had a maximum growth of 4.5% in 2000 and a minimum growth of -0.3% in 2020 and 2021.
Both groups experienced a downward trend in earnings growth from 2020 to 2021. The
Most significant finding is that CPI adjusted workers consistently had lower earnings growth
compared to CPI unaffected workers, with both groups experiencing a decline in earnings
growth in recent years.
